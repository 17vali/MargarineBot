<h1>Margarine's Terms of Service</h1>
The agreements for the users of Margarine due to Discord's Developer Terms of Service (Defined as Discord TOS).

**Last Updated:** 22 November 2019

**Usage:**
By using Margarine, users agree to have their information usable and manipulated for improving and general use of Margarine. Any data collected will be collected anonymously and, in most cases, not stored.

There are two stages of data agreement in which users can interact with Margarine. 

By inviting Margarine into the guild, all users within the guild agree to the first stage. Data stored about the users on this stage is any guild configuration settings, any temporary data like a music queue provided by Margarine's own commands, and any temporary cache of the user handled by the Discord.js library. Discord.js is a required package which allows Margarine to communicate with Discord's API. Margarine uses the "master" branch of this library which can be seen and provided by through their Github page linked here: https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js.

Users who have used Margarine's daily command at least once agree to the second stage. As apart of Discord's TOS, users need to give Margarine explicit permission to store user data outside of Discord. The daily command is a way to ensure that the user agrees to such permissions. The daily command sets up a user profile with can contain items such as: virtual currency (credits), reputation points, usernames for other profiles, etc... Any usernames for other sites are stored with the user's permission via other appropriate commands. All user information is stored under their unique Discord ID.

All credits, reputation points, and inventory items are generated and hold no real monetary value. They are purely for entertainment and users who use credits, reputation points, or inventory items for real monetary sales and profits are to be reported.

Users are generally asked to make reports about any issues or feedback of Margarine through its report command. Under Discord TOS, this doesn't require any permission from the user as all information is stored exclusively on Discord.

**Developer Version Usage:**

For users of the developer version of Margarine, a command may be reload with `console.log()` to check variables as they pass through the command. This data is not stored, however, users are required to know and accept that their data maybe logged for developmental reason during any fixes and/or improvements.

**Data Requests and Removal:**

Any users may contact the developer for their data on Margarine at any time using the contact information defined in the contact section. The user information will be sent to them in the most convenient way for both partied and decrypted for general viewing. After the data has been received, the developer will delete the sent file 48-72 hours later. The data received is up to the user's responsibility and discretion.

For users who want their user profile deleted, they may message the developer in the contact section below. The data will be deleted with no questions asked. However, users should be warned that there is no way to recover the lost data once deleted. For self-hosted versions of Margarine, the user must send their request to the person responsible for the hosted instance.

**Self-Hosting**

For any issues relating to a self-hosted instance of Margarine, the user must send their requests to the person responsible for the self-hosting. The developer is not responsible for any misuse conducted by the self-hosted instances of the program. However, if general questions about Margarine do arise, please see the Contact section of the terms for information on how to get in touch with the developer.

**Disclaimer:**

If for any reason Margarine needs to store more data, these terms will change with notice in future releases. If users are using the developer version of Margarine, these terms may change overnight. The developer will try to pass the news on quickly, however, cannot guarantee that the news will be current before the changes happen. Any questions based on recent changes, please refer to the Contact section of this file.

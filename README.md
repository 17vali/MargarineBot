<b>Introduction:</b>

Created through part-desire, part-what can I do in Discord, part-I'm going to learn Javascript, and part-it's only 12 am thoughts, Margarine has been my personal project for several years now. For the amount of time and effort I've spent on developing him, I'm quite proud of the functionality and features that I've put into him. I have received plenty of support over his development and I can't thank those people enough as without that support, Margarine would have never been as big or as good as he is today. I hope that you enjoy either looking at/learning/using Margarine as much as I do.

*Name Origin:* My typical nickname is Butter, as in the stuff that you put on toast. His name comes from the artificial butter (I tends to call it 'Fake Butter') you can buy in stores called, Margarine.

<b>Features:</b>
- Moderation commands
- Permission levels
- Fun, small games like Rock, Paper, Scissors
- Server/User/role info commands
- Economy system using a SQLite database
